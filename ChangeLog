	* CairoSurface.xs: fixed a bug in wrapping of cairo_surface_xlib_create
	where the return value wasn't being caught in RETVAL. thank you -Wall -W

	* cairo-perl.h: wrapped new includes (prev log msg) in #ifdef HAS's so
	that we can build on systems where no all backends are supported. XS
	code already supports this.
