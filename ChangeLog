	* Cairo.pm, Cairo.xs, t/Cairo.t: Replace the %backends hash with
	Cairo::HAS_PS_SURFACE, HAS_PDF_SURFACE, HAS_XLIB_SURFACE,
	HAS_FT_FONT and HAS_PNG_FUNCTIONS.

	* Cairo.pm, CairoPattern.xs, CairoSurface.xs, Makefile.PL:
	Implement the pattern and surface hierarchy suggested by the
	language bindings guidelines.

	* Cairo.xs: Use Cairo::Context for the namespace of cairo_t,
	instead of just Cairo, as suggested by the guidelines.

	* Cairo.xs, CairoFont.xs, CairoMatrix.xs, CairoPattern.xs,
	CairoSurface.xs, cairo-perl.h: Add new, remove old API.  Shuffle
	some things around.

	* Cairo.xs: Convert font and text extents and glyphs to and from
	native Perl data structures.

	* Cairo.xs, cairo-perl.h, cairo-perl.typemap: Remove everything
	that cannot be used from Perl, like the XLib and Glitz stuff.

	* CairoPath.xs, t/CairoPath.t: Add support for cairo_path_t,
	including a nice tied interface that lets you iterate over paths
	as if they were normal array references.

	* MakeHelper.pm: Extend the typemap generator to support "const"
	and "_noinc" types.  Change the enum handling to use the Glib
	convention, i.e. lowercase and hyphen instead of underscore.

	* Makefile.PL, README: Use ExtUtils::Depends.

	* examples/simple.pl, examples/png/caps_join.pl,
	examples/png/hering.pl, examples/png/outline.pl,
	examples/png/spiral.pl, examples/png/splines_tolerance.pl,
	examples/png/stars.pl: Update the examples to make them work again
	after all those API changes.

	* t/Cairo.t, t/CairoFont.t, CairoMatrix.t, CairoPattern.t,
	CairoSurface.t: Redo and/or expand the whole test suite.

	* CairoSurface.xs: fixed a bug in wrapping of cairo_surface_xlib_create
	where the return value wasn't being caught in RETVAL. thank you -Wall -W

	* cairo-perl.h: wrapped new includes (prev log msg) in #ifdef HAS's so
	that we can build on systems where no all backends are supported. XS
	code already supports this.

	* cairo-perl.h: Track split-up of cairo.h.

2004/11/28 13:20 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL, MakeHelper.pm: initial import of MakeHelper, mess of
	code moved out of Makefile.PL into it. beginning of cleaning all that 
	up. File::Spec now used.

	* examples/png/*: initial import of port of cairo-demo/png examples,
	except text.

	* META.yml: unknown version

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP: updates

2004/11/11 22:10 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/CairoMatrix.t, t/CairoPattern.t, t/CairoSurface.t: initial import,
	95% complete tests

	* Cairo.xs, CairoMatrix.xs, CairoSurface.xs, CairoPattern.xs: no more
	new's, not really a good idea.
	
	* CairoFont.xs: all disabled for now

	* CairoMatrix.xs: copy, multiply, and transforms fixed while doing
	tests

	* CairoPattern.xs: get_matrix fixed whlie doing tests

	* CairoSurface.xs: cleaned up the namespace problems herein. fixed
	several output funcs.

	* MANIFEST: added TODO and new tests.

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: skip CairoEnums.xs

	* t/Cairo.t: no new test, change Surface stuff due to namespace above

	* TODO: initial import

	* Cairo.pm, Cairo.xs: added %backends facility

	* Cario.xs, CairoSurface.xs: stuff moved out of Cairo.xs that belonged
	here

	* Cairo.xs: fixed some OUTLIST stuff (IN_OUTLIST.) cairo_current_matrix
	fixed. 

	* CairoPattern.xs: added class param to create_for_surface

	* Makefile.PL: seperated structs out of objects. add refs to object
	typemaps OUTPUT sections. don't return full strings for OUTPUT enum
	types.

	* cairo-perl.h: don't need stdio.h

	* t/Cairo.t: test most all of cairo type. 90% done.

2004/11/08 20:44 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Cairo.xs, CairoMatrix.xs, CairoPattern.xs, CairoSurface.xs: all of 
	the create functions have been cleaned up/fixed. debug prints removed.
	create's alised to new's where appropriate.

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP: ChangeLog added. build and CVS skipped

	* Makefile.PL, cairo-perl.h, Cairo.xs: new (write_)boot code added,
	in progress. use build dir for most of autogen'd stuff
